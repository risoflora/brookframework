## Overview

Brook is a cross-platform microframework which helps to develop web Pascal
applications built by [Delphi][5] or [Lazarus IDE and Free Pascal][6].
Its core has been developed using the [Sagui library][7], that's why it is so
fast, compact and useful to run on embedded systems.

## Features

- **Three threading modes:**
  - Event-driven - single-thread + polling.
  - Threaded - one thread per request.
  - Polling - pre-allocated threads.
  - Isolated request - request processed outside main thread.
- **Fast path routing that supports:**
  - Regular expression with [JIT][8] optimization.
  - [Binary search][9] for path entry-points.
- **HTTP compression:**
  - [Deflate][10] - for static strings and streaming.
  - [Gzip][11] - for file compression.
- **HTTP cookies:**
  - Providing classes which handles server side cookies.
- **HTTPS support:**
  - Data encryption through [GnuTLS][12] library.
- **Dual stack:**
  - IPv4 and IPv6 on top of a single socket.
- **Basic authentication:**
  - For standard login using username and password.
- **Upload/download:**
  - Static body and payload.
  - Content streaming for real-time applications.
  - Small and large files transferring.
- **Mathematical expression evaluator:**
  - Arithmetic, bitwise and logical operators.
  - Variables allocation at build and/or run time.
  - Macro support to define functions at run time.
  - Extendable with custom functions.
  - Error handling with error kind and position.
- **Media types:**
  - Resolving media types ([MIME][13]) in any supported platform.
- **Logging:**
  - Allowing to generate logs in console or files.
- **String buffer:**
  - For fast operations involving strings.
- **String map:**
  - Hashed lists for key-value mapping.
- **And more:**
  - Discover more features by playing with our examples.

## Examples

The example below shows a minimal `hello world` HTTP server:

```delphi
type
  THTTPServer = class(TBrookHTTPServer)
  protected
    procedure DoRequest(ASender: TObject; ARequest: TBrookHTTPRequest;
      AResponse: TBrookHTTPResponse); override;
  end;

procedure THTTPServer.DoRequest(ASender: TObject; ARequest: TBrookHTTPRequest;
  AResponse: TBrookHTTPResponse);
begin
  AResponse.Send('Hello world', 'text/plain', 200);
end;

begin
  with THTTPServer.Create(nil) do
  try
    Port := 8080;
    Open;
    if not Active then
      Exit;
    WriteLn('Server running at http://localhost:', Port);
    ReadLn;
  finally
    Free;
  end;
end.
```

There are other examples available in the [`Examples`](Examples) directory.

## Downloading

All stable releases are available to download via [GetIt][20], [OPM][21] and
GitHub [releases page][22].

We strongly recommend you to install Brook using GetIt or OPM, however, if you
want to download the very latest source from the Git repository, do this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/risoflora/brookframework.git
```

It will create a directory named `brookframework` filled with the source code.

## Documentation
